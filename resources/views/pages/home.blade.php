				<h2>Project Scoping</h2>
				<p>We met with our client to define the goals for our project. Afterwards, we decided on the scope of the project and created a project timeline.</p>

				<h2>Literature Review</h2>
				<p>Team members read scientific papers of past NASA research on the following areas: the history of Apollo surface missions, Earth-based analog missions, planetary geology, and various designs and prototypes of procedural aids (including cuff checklists, cue cards, and digital devices). We used this secondary research to answer our initial questions about the domain. </p>

				<h2>Core Research</h2>
				<p>We took a two-step approach: field and domain research. We observed our clients running a practice traverse. Then, in order to build empathy for our users, we conducted our own traverse. We wanted to physicaly and emotional experience of an analog mission. </p>

				<h2>Research Synthesis</h2>
				<p>We utilized two main synthesis methodologies: modeling and affinity diagramming. Modeling the usersâ€™ emotional and logistical journeys during a traverse enabled us to visualize pain points and breakdowns. eanwhile, the affinity process empowered us to synthesize data across all of our research by having us deconstruct the data into single units of information and reconstruct the units into meaningful groups.</p>

				<h2>Iterative Prototyping</h2>
				<p>We created many low-fidelity designs and tested them with users and our client. Then we narrowed down to a few ideas and tested them again. After we decided on one idea, we continued to refine our solution by prototying and testing rapidly.</p>
