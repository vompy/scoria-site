				<h1>Reimagining the Future</h1>
				<h2>Kicking off our visioning phase with a brainstorm of over 100 design ideas</h2>

				<p class="date">20 May 2016</p>
				<p>After presenting our research to the HCI group at NASA and to our users on the BASALT team, we orchestrated a visioning session that utilized the collective creativity in the room. We guided the group through an ideation exercise in which craziness was encouraged and any idea was fair game.</p>
				<p>We held another visioning session within the team to capture any thoughts that have been brewing in our own heads during our months of diligent research. We ideated in all shapes and forms: we drew; we wrote; we thought; we talked; we got stuck; we thought some more; we acted; and we built. And through it all, we created a whole wall of design ideas in a smattering of opportunity spaces.</p>

				<h1>Mapping Our Ideas to Technologies</h1>
				<h2>Giving order to our ideas and assessing feasibility</h2>

				<p class="date">15 Feb 2016</p>
				<p>Field geology is a tactile, whole-body activity. To ensure that the EV has the ergonomic capacity for a new tool, we started our technical feasibility analysis by mapping ideas directly onto the human body. This explicit mapping also framed our attention to ideas that maximized a humanâ€™s unique capabilities.</p>

				<h2>Developing our designs into low-fidelity prototypes</h2>

				<p class="date">15 Mar 2016</p>
				<p>After generating a plethora of ideas with zero inhibitions, we started to put form to them. Using an assortment of crafts, we built a first iteration embodiment of our leading concepts. As we tested with users, the walls of reality started to close in, we embraced the constraints to make judgement calls on the feasibility of our designs.</p>

				<h2>Scoping down our design to a specific user scenario</h2>

				<p class="date">15 Mar 2016</p>
				<p>After building low fidelity prototypes, we recognized that our ideas still spanned several dimensions of scope. Our next step was to make choices in the dimensions of user scenario, futurism, and technology.</p>
				<p>We decided to focus on the act of capturing scientific descriptions during a geologic traverse. From our research, this user scenario is in greatest need of design attention and it informs the most pivotal point in the traverse process: determining the leaderboard of sample priorities.</p>
