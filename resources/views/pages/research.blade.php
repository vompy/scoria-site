				<h1>We enrolled in NASA 101</h1>
				<h2>Kicking off our research with a self-guided introductory course in space exploration</h2>

				<p>To gain a foundational understanding of our problem space, we exposed ourselves to as much information about relevant NASA operations as possible. We did not set out to become experts, but to develop a comfortable familiarity with the domain.</p>
				<p>Team members read scientific papers of past NASA research on the following areas: the history of Apollo surface missions, Earth-based analog missions, planetary geology, and various designs and prototypes of procedural aids (including cuff checklists, cue cards, and digital devices). We used this secondary research to answer our initial questions about the domain. From there, we strategized a primary research plan to solve the remaining unanswered questions.

				<h1>We sought out similar fields of work</h1>
				<h2>Some aspects of doing geology on Mars are not so unique to doing geology on Mars</h2>

				<p>We recognized that many dimensions of our problem space relate quite well to other domains of work, so we went out and talked to professionals in a myriad of different fields. By strategically focusing on the relevant aspects of their work, we extracted the information that would be most useful for informing our own progress.

				<h1>We asked geologist about their needs</h1>
				<h2>The team went to the Goddard Space Flight Center to visit NASA geologists</h2>

				<p>At Goddard, we met with four planetary geologists who sometimes doubled as participants in NASA’s practice missions for Mars. We had exactly one hour with them. So, rather than a traditional face-to-face interview, we decided to tap into their creative side with two co-creation exercises and a box of colored pencils. With these exercises, the most salient problems bubbled to the top.

				<h2>By putting ourselves in our user’s shoes, we were able to internalize their struggles</h2>

				<p>Instead of Mars, we studied a local park with the science objective of characterizing its tree life. We recreated the workflow by assigning ourselves to the three main roles in a Mars traverse and by simulating a time delay between “Mars” and “Earth”. Using Google Maps as our remote imaging data, we planned a path before the mission. We then identified samples of interest (such as acorns) and equipped our astronaut with Tupperware to collect them.
